# CAP-JEE_merge
So basically I have made a complete working code for extracting application id from cap round pdf and search for all JEE percentiles in all India merit list. this is based on python libraries like numpy,pandas,pypdf2,etc. I have successfully extracted data of my college (GCOEN) which i attached below
- You can use this code (cap_and_jee.py) for your college too.
# Benifit of using my code for this purpose\
  - You will get real time progess bar possible via tqdm library (just go to terminal --> pip install tqdm).
  - Made with using many try except so there are no chances of error.
  # Steps to use the following code
 1. Just download the cap round pdf for your college from fe2025.mahacet.org --> Institue Wise Allotment List.
 2. Save the pdf named as CAP.pdf and download it in the folder where this code is pasted to avoid path errors.
 3. Download the JEE pdf from fe2025.mahacet.org --> All India Merit List.
 4. Save the pdf named as JEE.pdf and download it in the folder where this code is pasted to avoid path errors.
 5. Run the python code it will take around 10 - 15 mins (depends on your computer hardware).
 6. After that it will produce ALL_CAP_JEE_MERGED.csv file which contains scores of both JEE and MHT-CET
 7. Additionally it also contains scores of 12th and 10th boards too.

# Bonus Tip:-
  - You can convert .csv file to any file extension based on your requirements just go to freeconvert.com and convert it
